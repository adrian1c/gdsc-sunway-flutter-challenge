# GDSC Sunway Flutter Challenge

First, fix the errors that are preventing the app from building.

After building, here are some bugs. Please solve them.
1. When an item name is entered and the 'Add' Button is pressed, why is it not adding the item inside of the list? The state is not updating. Fix the issue.
2. Align the 'Add' Button so that it is positioned next to the Text Field, in the same row.
3. The 'Delete All' Button is reverting the list back to its default values. Please fix the button so that the list will be emptied upon clicking.
4. Why are the list items having no color? Change the color of the items inside of the list into any other color.
5. Add some padding to each list element, so that it has some separation in between each other.
6. Make the color of the elements in the list have rounded borders.
